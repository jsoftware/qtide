github builds

Whenever the qtide repo is updated, the linux/macos/windows Jqt binaries are built and written to:

  https://github.com/jsoftware/qtide/releases/tag/build

and copied to the J webserver developers download folder:

  https://www.jsoftware.com/download/j904/qtidedev

-----------
Not yet done:
If the latest commit has a new version number in common.pri, then the binaries are also copied to the user download folder:

  https://www.jsoftware.com/download/j904/qtide
-----------

The process is defined in the workflow file:

  .github/workflows/jqtide.yml

This workflow references files in the repo script folder: makelinux.sh, makemac.sh and makewin.cmd.

Builds take place on runners which are machines created dynamically for each OS. Elapsed time is around 25 minutes for a successful run.

To see the status of a run, login to github and visit

  https://github.com/jsoftware/qtide/actions

Recent runs are shown with a status mark. Drill down into a run name for the compile logs.

Github actions are documented at https://docs.github.com/en/actions.
